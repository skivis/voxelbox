# Voxelbox

> An atempt at a Minecraft-ish game with WebGL.

## Local development

Run the game in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

```sh
npm start
```

Build a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```sh
npm run build
```

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.
